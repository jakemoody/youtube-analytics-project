# youtube-analytics-project
This repo has some fun with data from Saturday Night Live's public YouTube Channel. Specifically, this repo contains R scripts that:

- Data collection with YouTube's API
- Scrape and clean HTML from Wikipedia's website
- Perform some exploratory data analysis and look at discriptive statistics 
  - How does the host impact video count? 
  - How does the musical gues impact video count? 
  - If the video was about the 2016 Electio, was there an effect?
